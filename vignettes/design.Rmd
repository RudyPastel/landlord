Given the increasing demand for production grade R development and the scarcity 
of skilled R developers, principled, articulated effective craftsmanship is an 
asset. As a consequence, I created the `landlord` project as both a training 
ground and a demonstration of  my skills. In particular, this vignette documents
my choices and my rationales. Comments, evaluations and improvement suggestions 
are welcomed.


## Overview of key choices

* `landlord` is implemented within the [{golem}](https://engineering-shiny.org/) framework
* `landlord` relies on [R6](https://r6.r-lib.org/) object oriented programming
* `landlord` exposes a REST API implemented with [plumber](https://www.rplumber.io/)



## Goal

> Decide whether a rental property investment is profitable

`landlord` helps budding investors in their first steps. Given a property and a
loan, it calculates future cash flows and profitability.

This is a na√Øve investment mental model but it is rich enough to practice 
R programming in a somewhat realistic context: my cousin, my brother and I *are*
budding real estate investors.

## Users, deployment and user experience

Project circumstances usually define these aspects. However, in this personal
project, I will, base on my experience.

### Personas

Rudy, Ralph and Jeremy are three cousins interested in real estate investments.
They want to identify worthwhile opportunities by evaluating simple indicators.


* Jeremy has real estate investment experience: he can name indicators of interest
to evaluate investments. He is a fitness coach and has no technical knowledge.
* Ralph is new to real estate investment and wants very safe investments.
Ralph is a product manager and will have suggestions about UX. He can however
not program.
* Rudy is new to real estate investment and is willing to loose some money to learn.
Rudy studied mathematics, is tech literate and actually programs `landlord`.

### Deployment

For three users, developing for multiple devices would be excessive. The app
will be made for desktop use. Other devices may be considered later for practice
sake. Furthermore, I want the code to be accessible to potential customers. When
the code is mature, I will consider deploying it to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).

Accordingly, 

* The app will be publicly accessible on [www.shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) in the free tier
* The code is available on [Github](https://github.com/RudyPastel/landlord)

### User experience

I will stick to my core development competences and [Shiny dashboards](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/)
to enable the `landlord` usage via mouse and clicks.

## `{golem}` framework

[Engineering with Shiny](https://engineering-shiny.org/) suggests to structure the
code as a [R package](https://r-pkgs.org/) and provides an opinionated framework
called `{golem}` which promises production grade Shiny dashboard. Confronting 
my practice to their principles may prove very beneficial. 


## Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

As I bring R code to production, a basic understanding of OOP can support more 
effective communication with software engineers and richer software design.
In [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html), [Hadley Wickham](https://hadley.nz/)
presents various ways to do [OOP in R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/oo.html#oop-in-r).
I chose to focus on R6 in this project because

1. R6 benefits from a full fledged [documentation](https://r6.r-lib.org/)
1. R6 resembles OOP in Python which fellow data scientists often use
1. S4 seems too strict a start point for such a simple project
1. S3 seems so simple as to be tested in client project

In practice, investors, properties and objects are implemented as R6 classes and
combined into a the investment R6 class.

## REST API

Restful APIs are a staple of modern software development and it is important I
can develop APIs to my R products. The [plumber](https://www.rplumber.io/) is the
standard tool and will be used to return some information about the loan.
